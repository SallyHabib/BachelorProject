Maged & Sossa's Wedding,"Preserve them in your name so that they may be one, and I myself may be in them
john 17: 11

""On this day I take your hand and devote myself to you. On this day I will look into your eyes and commit to our future. On this day, our wedding day, I will promise to love and cherish you all my life""

The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church. It's a choice we make - not just on our wedding day, but over and over again

We invite you to share our happiness on Thursday May 9th at 8:00 pm.
""Our happily ever after begins today.""

P.S: It's a funny thing that when a man hasn't anything on earth to worry about, he goes off and gets married.

ErsteTika - ارستاتيكا,"إلى كل newcomers مفحوت فى الإمتحانات :D
وإليك أيضا أيها ال enrolled يالى في أجازة و مرتاح ويالى أتخرجت كمان :D

- أنتوا مين ؟
احنا Big Buddy وهدفنا نساعد الnewcomers فعملنا online campaign اسمه ""ErsteTika"" أو "" ارستاتيكا "" !

- مين بيقول ايه ؟
ارستاتيكا او ErsteTika ده مش صينى ولا يابانى ده ألمانى على إنجليزى كده :D
""erste"" معناها أول بالألمانى و ""Tika"" مشتقة من كلمة tips :)

- مش فاهم أى حاجة !
هى حملة معمولة للnewcomers بنقدم فيها نصايح وخبرات مرينا بيها فى فترة الأمتحانات أيام سنة اولى :)

كلنا هنشارك  .. لازم كل واحد يقولنا خبرته العميقة العظيمة فى الإمتحانات ^_^

- يعنى أنا دلوقتى مطلوب منى ايه ؟
لو أنت newcomer ، مش مطلوب منك غير أنك تتابع الposts إلى على الevent وإلى على الpage ^_^
بس لو أنت enrolled أو متخرج يبقى :
1. لو عايز تنصح نصيحة عامة يعنى شكل البوست كالمثال :
#ErsteTika
#ارستاتيكا
#انصحنى_شكرا
ذاكر كويس :)
2. لو عايز تنصح نصيحة لمادة معينة شكل البوست كالمثال :
#ErsteTika
#ارستاتيكا
# (واسم المادة بقى)

الطريقة دى حتسهل عالnewcomer أنه يشوف النصايح :)
وخليك فاكر ..

Bishoy asked and Monica accepted !! (Bisho & Kouki Engagement),"“I will betroth you to Me forever;
Yes, I will betroth you to Me
In righteousness and justice,
In lovingkindness and mercy""
~ Hosea 2: 19
Engagement isn't about a ring, it isn't about gathering of family and friends... 
It is about two persons who decided to ask for the Lord together, They decided to serve Him and hold His Hands to pass through great moments as well as hard ones as He Said : ""Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven."" ~ Mathew 18:19 and we agreed to Hold His hands and we are sure He will never let go.

we are honored to invite you to pray with us and for us on our new start... on our Engagement.
it will be on Saturday 9th of November (9.11.13 as in the photo above :D) 4.00 pm exactly at St. Mark Church (Cleopatra)

and finally we say : ""Set me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death"" ~ Song 8:6 
we will be joyful if you spend these wonderful moments with us.

""وأخطُبُكِ لنَفسي إلَى الأبدِ. وأخطُبُكِ لنَفسي بالعَدلِ والحَقِّ والإحسانِ والمَراحِمِ."" ~هوشع 2 : 19 
الخطوبة ليست عبارة عن خاتم أو تجمع للعائلة والأصدقاء ..
هي عبارة عن شخصين قرروا ان يطلبوا الرب سويا, قرروا ان يخدموه ويمسكوا في يده ليعبروا اللحظات الجيد منها والصعب كما قال : ""وأقولُ لكُمْ أيضًا: إنِ اتَّفَقَ اثنانِ مِنكُمْ علَى الأرضِ في أيِّ شَيءٍ يَطلُبانِهِ فإنَّهُ يكونُ لهُما مِنْ قِبَلِ أبي الّذي في السماواتِ"" ~متى 18 : 19 ... ونحن قررنا ان نمسك يديه واثقين أنه لن يتركنا.

نتشرف بدعوتكم لتصلوا معنا ولنا من اجل هذه البداية الجديدة ... خطوبتنا 
ستكون يوم السبت الموافق 9 نوفمبر 2013 الساعة 4.00 مساء في كنيسة مارمرقص بمصر الجديدة (كليوباترا).

وأخيرا نقول : ""اِجعَلني كخاتِمٍ علَى قَلبِكَ، كخاتِمٍ علَى ساعِدِكَ. لأنَّ المَحَبَّةَ قَويَّةٌ كالموتِ."" ~نشيد 8 : 6
