Unravel Your Entrepreneurial Side 2.0,"Being an entrepreneur is a never ending process of exposing oneself to new experiences. With each new experience, a new side is realized within oneself. And since a side that Canvas GUC is very committed to unraveling in its community is the entrepreneurial one, Canvas is hereby proudly announcing the return of last year’s “Unravel your entrepreneurial side”.

Join us in Canvas’s second event of its type which will be an upgrade to last year’s. With an evolved experience this year, you’ll be truly witnessing entrepreneurship from the views of some of the entrepreneurs who made it. Our group of honorable guests is a diverse one from lots of different entrepreneurial paths that will relate to the audience’s different walks of life.

We’ll discuss several topics over the entrepreneurial sphere, from funding a startup to technology trends to even what would make entrepreneurship a bad option. And as we have mentioned our high regard to new experiences, be ready for a diverse event with some activities to involve you in the startup scene and a special emphasis on personal exposure to what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. Sounds a little intense to you? Don’t worry, because there’ll be a break in the middle to grab a bite.

The event will take place in the D1 Hall of the GUC. We'll start at 11:00 AM and finish by 05:00 PM. The event is open for GUCians and Non-GUCians are welcome as well!

For many years Facebook has been promoting innovation across the Middle East and Africa, providing startups with the tools they need to build, grow, monetize, and measure. Facebook grew out of a hacker culture, and we thrive on seeking out and promoting innovation on new platforms. That's why we are launching the Bots for Messenger Challenge, a contest to recognize and reward developers who are able to create the most innovative new bots on Messenger in (i) the Middle East and North Africa; and (ii) Sub-Saharan Africa across one of these these three categories:

1. Gaming and Entertainment
2. Productivity and Utility
3. Social Good
 
Teams of up to 3 people are invited to participate in the Challenge.
