"GUC COMPLAINT  "" Lack of parking spaces + Opening gate 2 for students""","If you are a GUCian who comes to campus by car and is fed of spending more than 30 minutes each day to find a parking spot for you car that is reasonably near the acessible gates as well as not having enough open gates for students. 
This is a formal complaint that is going to be presented to the customer’s service department in university to complain about the current parking situation, demand a fast solution for it, and request the opening of gate two for students. 
If you agree with the following complaint  here is what you need to do:

The complaint goes as follows, 
""To whom it may concern this petition is presented to you on behalf of the students who signed it to object on the current parking situation in university. Since last year's tragic incident that resulted in the death of our colleague Yara Tarek, the university took decisions concerning the redistribution of the buses to avoid the occurrence of such accidents in the future; the decisions that were taken completely disregarded other factors such as car parking spaces. Because of the decrease in the area of parking, the remaining area dedicated for the students’ cars does not even cover quarter of the number of the enrolled students with cars and as a result the students have to park outside the university campus. This, in turn, makes the students walk long distances to and from their classes. In fact, the further students park from an open gate, the longer they walk outside the university's campus and the more their safety is threatened as they become at risk of harassment, robbery, or even car theft in some cases. In addition, some students in majors such as Architecture or Applied arts carry a lot of tools or models, and walking long distances carrying these tools and models is very hard and tiring; first, because of the distance and second, because of the sloped topography of the land. In light of the apparently threatening and unpleasant situation, we urge you to take action concerning the highlighted issues by finding a fast solution for the parking situation in order to improve the students’ campus lives and decrease the threats that accompany parking outside of campus. Until the improvement of the parking situation we request the opening of gate 2 for students; the gate is already open with security personnel it only lacks electronic gates. Opening gate 2 for students will reduce the distance that they have to walk especially if they have parked in the street between Arabella compound and the university. The distance between gates 1 and 4, which are already open for students, is about 626 meters long, according to google earth; that is more than half a kilometer of sloped ground that does not have any gates in between to serve as access. Consequently, opening gate 2 for students will make life easier for many of us who take classes in the B or the C buildings, as well as reduce the distance for those of us who take classes in the D building who already walk a very long distance inside of campus. In the end, we would like to thank you for receiving our complaints and suggestions and hope that you will consider them at the nearest convenience.""

A soul mate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys to fit our locks. Each unveils the best part of the other. No matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we’re safe in our own paradise.

Our soul mate is someone who shares our deepest longings, our sense of direction.

Our soul mate is the one who makes life come to life.
