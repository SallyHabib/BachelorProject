Unravel Your Entrepreneurial Side 2.0,"Being an entrepreneur is a never ending process of exposing oneself to new experiences. With each new experience, a new side is realized within oneself. And since a side that Canvas GUC is very committed to unraveling in its community is the entrepreneurial one, Canvas is hereby proudly announcing the return of last year’s “Unravel your entrepreneurial side”.

Join us in Canvas’s second event of its type which will be an upgrade to last year’s. With an evolved experience this year, you’ll be truly witnessing entrepreneurship from the views of some of the entrepreneurs who made it. Our group of honorable guests is a diverse one from lots of different entrepreneurial paths that will relate to the audience’s different walks of life.

We’ll discuss several topics over the entrepreneurial sphere, from funding a startup to technology trends to even what would make entrepreneurship a bad option. And as we have mentioned our high regard to new experiences, be ready for a diverse event with some activities to involve you in the startup scene and a special emphasis on personal exposure to what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. Sounds a little intense to you? Don’t worry, because there’ll be a break in the middle to grab a bite.

The event will take place in the D1 Hall of the GUC. We'll start at 11:00 AM and finish by 05:00 PM. The event is open for GUCians and Non-GUCians are welcome as well!

مش هنشحن,"هنقاطع شركات الاتصالات من يوم 30 \ 9 عشان غلاء اسعار كروت الشحن والانترنت الارضى وعشان سوء خدمة الانترنت وعدم تطويرها.

اسعار الكروت حالياً هتتخفض قيميتها بنسبة 36% يعنى رصيد الـ 100 رصيد بـ 143ج !! وعشان كده 

- يومياً من 6 مساءً لـ 12 مساءً هنعمل موبايلاتنا airplane mode 
 مش هنشترى خط المصريه للاتصالات الجديد 015 #WE
- هنقاطع شراء الكروت والشحن فى كل الشركات او هنقلل الشحن على موبايلاتنا لحد ما يحصل تغيير ويتراجعوا عن القرار.
- متتعاملش مع خط المصريه للاتصالات الـ 015 يعنى متردش على 015 ولا تتصل بـ 015
- قلل مكالماتك واستخدم السوشيال ميديا عشان توصل لاي حد.. رسايل او صوت ومتتكلمش من الموبايل الا للضروره
- تشارك معانا فى الايفينت ده مش هنشحن
- غير صورة بروفايلك زيي من هنا https://goo.gl/zvmv6t واعلن مقاطعتك للشركه دى نهائياً
- اعمل #شير للايفينت ومنشن لاصحابك وتقاطع.. تقاااطع !!
- خد الايفينت وابعته لكل اصحابك على الماسنجر و واتس اب وغيره.. وشير الايفينت فى كل الجروبات
- انشر الهاشتاج ده فى كل مكااان #مش_هنشحن
متسيبش حقك , متخليش حد يسوقك ويستغفلك ويضحك عليك !!

InnenHofKonzerte 2018 – Auftakt,"Erstes InnenHofkonzert am 3. Mai im Tierheim Hof

Am Donnerstag, den 3. Mai gehen sie wieder los – die InnenHofKonzerte. Im parkähnlichen Eingangsbereich des Tierheims Hof erwartet die Besucher der urige Oberkrainersound der „Frankenkrainer“. Die Musiker, die schon seit über 30 Jahren auf Festen wie dem Schlappentag oder dem Hofer Volksfest aufspielen, sind weit über die Region hinaus bekannt.
„Back to the Roots“ lautet ihr Motto in der neuen Formation und man darf sich auf 5 Herzblut-Musiker freuen, die auch die InnenHofKonzerte wieder zu ihren Wurzeln zurückführen: Ein schöner Gartenhof, unverstärkte Musik und selbstgemachte Brotzeiten.

Für Letztere sorgen die ehrenamtlichen Mitarbeiter des Tierheims und Tierschutzvereins Hof und die Metzgerei Strobel aus Dörnthal. Bratwürste vom Strohschwein, Steaks und auch selbstgemachte vegetarische und vegane Snacks umfasst das Angebot. Natürlich sind auch die Brauerei Scherdel und die Weinhandlung Kretschmann als jahrelange InnenHofKonzert-Sponsoren wieder mit im Boot.

Alle Ausgestalter des Konzerts, angefangen von den Musikanten bis hin zum Catering, verzichten zugunsten des Tierheims auf Gagen und Berechnungen. Im Namen des Tierheims und des Stadtmarketing Hof e.V. ergeht an dieser Stelle ein herzliches Dankeschön!

InnenHofKonzert von 19.00 -21.00 Uhr. Eintritt frei.

Blockchain Distributed Ledgers,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, zCash, Ripple, Dash, OmiseGo, Dfinity... the list goes on and on. All these  systems share two things: a chain of blocks of data replicated across thousands of computers all over the world that don't trust one another, and a load of controversy about their existence. ""Blockchain"" is a new buzz word used to describe decentralized ecosystems designed to be operated trustlessly by  participants in their networks. In this talk, I'll present you with a high-level overview of the technology and its implications for our present day-to-day lives, and debunk some of the myths and false promises circulating.

Duration: 1h 30m (40m + 10m break + 40m)

Plastic Minds with Egychology - ايجيكولوجي,"[Arabic text below]

NOTE : THIS EVENT IS FOR GUCians ONLY!

Have you ever wanted to learn a new skill then voices inside your head told you that you can't ...  that it's too late! NO it's never too late. 
You could learn a new skill everyday 😃

Thoughts..emotions.. 
The repetition of small changes leads to neural pathways. Why do you think we behave differently nowadays than 10 years ago? It’s because our brains are constantly being shaped. 

This is called ""Neuroplasticity"".

It’s the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. The nerve cells’ activities are adjusted in response to new situations. And more to learn from our great speaker Ahmed Samir who is known for his famous youtube channel Egychology - ايجيكولوجي!

-Waiting for you all on Saturday 24th of February.

تنبيه هام : الحدث لطلاب الجامعة الألمانية فقط!

حاولت قبل كدا تتعلم حاجة جديه و دماغك كانت رافضه الفكره و بتقولك خلاص كدا كفايه عليك تعليم ؟ لا مش كفايه! 
انت ممكن تتعلم حجات كتير جديده كل يوم بشكل انت نفسك متتخيلوش

التفكير و العاطفه. تكرار حجات صغيره في حياتنا بيئدي لمشاكل مختلفه في السلوك العصبي لينا. تفتكر ليه دلوقتي واخدين فكره اننا كنا روشين جدا و احنا صغيرين مع ان دا كان صح 100% و انت صغير؟ دا ببساطه لأم المخ بيستوعب اكتر من اللي حوليه و بيكون لنفسه شصخيه مستقله و شكل معين يبقي انت عليه.

كل دا ملخصه في كلمه واحده اسمها ""Neuroplasticity"" !

هي قدره المخ علي استيعاب نفسه عن طريق تكوين خلايه جديده و توصيلات مختلفه بين خلايه المخ و بعضها بتكون شبكه. الشبكه دي هي اللي بتتحكم في تصرفتنا و شخصيتنا و تعاملنا مع المواقف المختلفه و اكتر هتعرفه مع Ahmed Samir صاحب اكبر قنوات اليوتيوب في الشرف الأوسط Egychology - ايجيكولوجي

فِتَن الجامعة,"السلام عليكن و رحمة الله و بركاته،

دخول الجامعة يتطلب التعرض لفتن لا مفر منها؛ لو كنتي دخلتي الجامعة أكيد مريتي بفتن في التعامل مع الناس، و مع الشباب و الدكاترة. أكيد وقعتي في فترة إيمانياً بسبب إنشغالك بالدراسة أو الحياة الجامعية، أكيد مكنتيش متأكدة انتي بتعملي الموضوع ده كله بنية ايه؟ بتدرسي ليه أصلاً؟ فيه فتن مختلفة كلنا ممكن نقف أمامها و منعرفش نتحرك أو نمشي إزاي من غير ما نتعلم. اليوم ده هنحاول نتعلم فيه إزاي نتعامل مع الفتن دي بالقرآن و السنة الصحيحة. و كمان هنتعرف علي بعض بحيث نفضل نتواصل خلال الدراسة و نثبت بعض. 

و البنات الجميلة ال لسه مدخلتش جامعة هتتعلم تبدأ علي نظافة :)
أي بنت مرحب بيها، سواءً في مدرسة أو جامعة أو خريجة 

المُعلمة: د. هالة الجعلي 
نحسبها ثقة و علي منهج القرآن و السنة و ماهرة بالتدريس اللهم بارك :)

Zewail City Science Festival 2016,"أكبر مشكلة ممكن تواجه أي حد بيقرأ في العلوم انه مش شايف اللي بيقرأه أو مش شايف تطبيقاته 
يعني لو بيقرأ في الكيميا صعب يفضل فاكر التفاعلات، لو بيقرا في الفيزيا أو الميكانيكا صعب يفهم قوانينها ونظرياتها من غير ما يعرف أصل القوى اللي في الطبيعة ومصدرها وازاي القوى دي بتطبق على الأجسام.  عشان كده السنه دي هدفنا انك تشوف العلوم بشكل مختلف, وتعرف ازاى ان حتي الفن ليه تفسيرات علميه 
ده هيحصل من خلال 3 أجزاء متقسمه علي مدار اليوم في الايفنت 
1-Empirical Tent 
2- Wonderland of Science 
3- Talks 
4- Science Cafe' 
5-The room of Femto-chemistry 
 ده شرح كل واحده من الفقرات اللي هناخدك فيها خلال اليوم D: 
1- Empirical tent 
 ال empirical tent هتكون عباره عن  خمس محطات  فيهم تجارب كتير في الكيميا والميكانيكا وتجارب بتشرح طبيعة الرعد وازاي الخداع البصري بيحصل وتجارب تانية هتخلى العلم بالنسبالك امتع ، و هتفهم حاجات كانت محيراك وقت طويل ;) 
******************************************************************************
 2- Wonderland of science
دي عباره عن ممر فيه 8 محطات, كل محطه بتدخل في عالم مختلف, بديكورات ومؤثرات بتعيشك جوا الفكره اللي المحطه بتشرحها وبتتكلم عنها, مش بس هتكون عن العلم لكن كمان في محطات فيها هتوريك الجانب العلمي لحاجات بتتعرضلها كل يوم, زي مثلا ليه عقلك بيحب المزيكا؟؟ ومحطات تانيه هتشرحلك اسئله أعمق زي مثلا ""الكون بدأ ازاى؟؟ وايه النظريات اللي البشر حطوها علي مر التاريخ لحد النهارده...طب هل فيها حاجات مش منطقيه؟؟  ولا اصلا في اجابه معروفه للسؤال ده ؟؟  ده كله هتعرفه في المحطه دي, باقي المحطات هتعرفها لما تنورنا في الفيستفال :) 
 
طب ليه سميناها كده ؟ 
لأن زي  ما alice في فيلم Alice in wonderland وقعت في حفره دخلتها لعالم تاني, ده بالظبط اللي هنعمله معاك, اننا هناخدك في عالم تاني تشوف فيه العلوم والمعرفه بشكل مختلف خالص عن اللي اتعلمته طول حياتك ;) 
*******************************************************************************
3- Talks 
دي محطه هتسمع فيها واحد من الSpeakers اللي جايين الايفنت بيتكلم في موضوع شيق يا اما موضوع علمي أو موضوع مرتبط بالفن, سواء الفن ده كان تصوير, كتابه,..... هيكون معانا عمر طاهر, أحمد الغندور ""الدحيح"" , د/شعبان خليل وناس تانيه كتير تابعنا عالبيدج عشان تعرف مين جاي تاني :D 
*******************************************************************************
4- Science Cafe' 
الScience Cafe' هو عباره عن مكان هتلاقي فيه مشروبات زي أي cafe دخلته قبل كده, بس الفرق الأهم هو إنك هتشرب مشروبك وانت قاعد بترغي مع العالم اللي تختاره D: 
يعني ممكن توقف أينشتاين وهو معدي من جنبك وتسأله عن اكتشافاته وازاى فادت العالم, وتقعد تتناقش معاه في النظريات الفيزيائيه وانت بتشرب الشاي :v  هيكون في اشخاص لابسين زي علماء وعالمات اثروا في تاريخ العلم موجودين في الكافيه العلمي تقدر تناقشهم في اكتشافات الشخصيه اللي لابسينها ويحكولك عن نظرياتهم وتاريخها.
 
بعد رحيل دكتور زويل قررنا ان جزء من الفيستفال هيكون مخصص انه يعرفك  ليه دكتور زويل  أخد نوبل, وليه إنجازاته العلميه عملت صدي مش بس في أمريكا لكن في كل مكان في العالم، هيكون فيه غرفة كاملة مخصصة لل Femtochemistry و فيها هنشرح البحث العلمي اللي كان سبب حصول دكتور زويل على جائزة نوبل في الكيمياء و هنشرح تطبيقات و أهمية الأبحاث اللي عملها وإزاى ده أثر علي مجالات كتير في العلم والصناعه. 
*******************************************************************************
إيه ال School Zone ؟ 
دي عباره عن جزء من الفيستفال مخصص للأطفال من سن 9 ل 12 سنه فيه انشطه وتجارب بتنقللهم المعرفه والعلم بشكل بسيط وسهل يستمتعوا بيه, تقدر تجيب إينك/ بنتك أو أختك/ أخوك الصغير وتغير فكرتهم عن المعرفه والعلم لباقي حياتهم.  
الجزء ده من الفيسفتال للفئه العمريه دي وبس وليه تذكره منفصله سعرها 35 جنيه

Inside your AC there’s a small computer, called a Microcontroller. Microcontrollers are used to program any device to be automated, Arduino is one of the most popular boards the use microcontrollers to control electronic circuits.

College Pathway,"المنح دايمًا بنعرف عنها حاجات في شكل خطوات وتعليمات، مبنكونش عارفين درجة صحتها أو واقعيتها، وبنكون حاسين ان الناس اللي بتاخد منح دي من كوكب تاني غيرنا و في فكرة دايما في دماغنا إننا عشان نسافر لازم يكون معانا فلوس او نكون من أوائل الثانوية العامة او نكون جايبين درجات خرافية في الامتحانات الدولية؛ هل دا صح؟ طب ازاي نقدم على المنح؟ نسبة قبولنا هل هتكون عالية ولا مفيش أمل؟ قوة الـ Application بتاعنا بتتحدد على أساس ايه؟ 

عشان كده  قررنا نجيبلك ناس من قلب التجربة، ناس سافروا وأخدوا منح فعلًا بمعنى أصح ناس فعلا يعرفوا يفيدوك عشان يحطّوك على أول الطريق، وعشان تعرف تفاصيل التقديم خطوة بخطوة وتكون على أرض ثابتة و تحررك من كل الشائعات اللي فوق دي

في College Pathway هتعرف عن 4 أنواع من المنح:
1- منح ألمانيا خاصة و أوروبا بشكل عام.      
يعني هتعرف ازاي تقدم على المنح و هل فعلا السفر لاوروبا محتاج منح ولا ممكن تقدر توفر انت الفلوس؟ و لو عايز تتعلم ألماني ايه المراكز المعتمة و الـ تاخد منها شهادات فعلا موثوقة و ايه الأماكن الـ تروحها علشان تعرف المنح الـ شغالة فالوقت دا.

2- منح أمريكا لطلاب الـ  undergraduate 
أمريكا فعلا من البلاد الغالية في التعليم حتى على الأمريكان نفسهم بس دا مش معناه اننا نفقد الأمل، أمريكا فيها اكتر من ٤٥٠٠ جامعة اكيد في واحدة فيهم تناسبك فكل حاجة و تديك منحة 

3- منح أمريكا لطلاب الـ Graduate 
ودي بقى نسيبها مفاجأة في اليوم علشان منبوظهاش عليكم بس هنجيبلكوا ناس عاشوا فعلا التجربة و يمكن لِسَّه عايشنها لغاية دلوقتي.

4- منح جوه مصر
المنح مش شرط تكون هتسافر بره، لو أنت عايز تتعلم تعليم أحسن في جامعات محترمة جوه مصر في جامعات زي (الجامعة الأمريكية والألمانية والبريطانية وجامعة النيل وجامعة زويل) هنقولك ازاي من الصفر 

هنستناكم يوم السبت 23-7 في جامعة زويل للعلوم والتكنولوجيا من 9 الصبح لـ5 مساءً، ويوم الأحد 24-7 هنكرر نفس البرنامج عشان اللي مش مناسبه الميعاد الأول

لو عندك فكرة وفريق عمل ينفذها يبقي شيء ممتاز 
لو أنت مهندس و فريقك ناقصه تخصص معين زي المبيعات أو التسويق او جزء معين في الTechnical ، ده المكان المناسب إلي تتعرف في علي ناس متخصصة وتكمل التيم بتاعك
لو إنت متخصص في مجال معين زي التصميم الصناعي أو البرمجة لكن مفيش فكرة معينة في دماغك وحابب تشارك، ممكن تنضم مع فريق عمل بتخصصك وتساهم في تنفيذ الفكرة :)
في كل الأحوال أهلاً بيك وأهم حاجة تستفاد من الثلاث أيام أقصى إستفادة :)
اهم حاجة الفيديو اللي هتعمله انت والتيم بتاعك عشان تقدر تقنع الmentors بفكرتك:)

- طيب والفيديو ده اعمله ازاي ؟
تقدر تفرا البوست ده كويس وتعمل فيديو زيه :D

TEDxGUC Associates' Recruitment,"In our ever-so dynamic world, everything is constantly evolving and restructuring into a stronger better version. We challenge ourselves with what we think will lead us to the pinnacle of our vision and become masters.
Through the evolution of our body in TEDxGUC into more refined specialised teams of high competence and proficiency, we are taking the steps to reach the state in which we see ourselves: mastership. 

Each innovative team of TEDxGUC aspires to provide its associates with the key to unlock their full potential. And being particularly specialised, each team undergoes a unique experience that empowers its associates to master their x. Consequently, because we believe in spreading ideas for progress and development, TEDxGUC is now recruiting associates to become a part of the journey to achieve mastership. 

There will be an orientation session on Thursday Dec. 3 in H12 and Monday Dec. 7 in H3 to acquaint you with TEDxGUC's vision and different teams as well as the x's they grant you to master. You are required to attend the session in order to reserve an interview spot. To register for the orientation, please fill in the google sheet in the following link: http://goo.gl/forms/0sOu7W0r3c
